# Sparky Joe Saves the Day — Game Jam Project

## Overview
This is a **2D puzzle-platformer** called **"Sparky Joe Saves the Day"**, built with **Phaser 3** for a game jam. The jam theme is **"Everything is connected"**.

## Game Concept
The player navigates through a series of interconnected puzzle rooms in a 2D side-scrolling platformer. Puzzles are built from reusable mechanical elements — sliding doors, elevators, drawbridges, and pushable blocks — that the player must manipulate to progress. The "everything is connected" theme manifests through puzzle mechanics where activating one element affects others in linked chains.

## Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Phaser 3 (v3.80+)
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES Modules)
- **Build:** Vite
- **Art Pipeline:** Mostly procedural textures at runtime; character PNGs loaded for menu and in-game use (`SparkyJoe_clean.png`, `hoodlum.png`, `mentor_small.png`). Enemies can be built from a single-pose PNG (see `src/assets/HoodlumSprite.js`). Environment props generated by `src/assets/EnvironmentTextures.js`.
- **Audio:** Web Audio API chiptune synthesizer (procedural, no external audio files)

## Key Conventions
- **ES Modules** throughout (`import`/`export`).
- **Phaser Scene lifecycle:** `preload()` → `create()` → `update()`.
- Puzzle elements are self-contained classes with `activate()`/`deactivate()` interface.
- Levels are **data-driven** — declarative objects in `src/levels/`, built by GameScene.
- Most textures are **procedurally generated** at runtime in PreloadScene. The menu screen loads `SparkyJoe_clean.png` as an external image. Additional PNGs loaded for enemies and NPCs.
- Music is **procedurally synthesized** via Web Audio API (no external audio files). A MIDI generator tool exists in `src/audio/MusicGenerator.js`.
- Constants and magic numbers go in `src/config.js`.
- Hero sprite is 48×64 pixels, physics tile size is 32×32.
- Game canvas is 1024×768 with zoom: 2 and FIT scale mode.

## Running the Game
```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # Start Vite dev server with hot reload
npm run build   # Production build to dist/
npm run preview # Preview production build
```

## AI Collaboration Notes
- Each subdirectory contains an `AGENTS.md` explaining that directory's purpose and contents.
- When generating code, follow the existing patterns in nearby files.
- All puzzle elements share a common interface so they can be wired together by the ConnectionSystem.
- Refer to `design/` for game design decisions before implementing features.
