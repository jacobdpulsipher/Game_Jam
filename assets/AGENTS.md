# assets/ — External Assets (Currently Unused)

## Purpose
Reserved for external non-code assets. **Currently unused** — all textures are procedurally generated at runtime in `src/assets/` and all music is procedurally synthesized via Web Audio API in `src/audio/`.

## Directory Layout
| Folder       | Contents |
|--------------|----------|
| `images/`    | Reserved for visual assets (sprite sheets, tilesets, backgrounds). Currently empty (`.gitkeep` placeholders). |
| `audio/`     | Reserved for music/SFX files. Currently empty — all audio is procedural. |
| `tilemaps/`  | Reserved for Tiled JSON exports. Currently unused — levels are data-driven JS files in `src/levels/`. |
| `fonts/`     | Reserved for custom fonts. Currently empty. |

## Notes
- All textures are generated in `src/scenes/PreloadScene.js` using `src/assets/AssetTextures.js` and `src/assets/ElectricianSprite.js`.
- All music is generated by `src/audio/ProceduralMusic.js` using the Web Audio API.
- If external assets are added in the future, load them in `PreloadScene.js` with `this.load.*()` calls.
